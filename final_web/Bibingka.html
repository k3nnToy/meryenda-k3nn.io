    <h1>Bibingka</h1>
    <p><strong>Bibingka</strong> is a beloved Filipino rice cake made with glutinous rice and coconut milk, traditionally cooked in clay pots lined with banana leaves. It’s often topped with salted eggs, cheese, and butter, offering a deliciously smoky flavor. Popular during Christmas season and Simbang Gabi!</p>
    <p>Its soft, fluffy texture combined with its sweet and salty taste makes Bibingka a festive treat that captures the heart of Filipino celebrations.</p>
