        <h1>Puto</h1>
        <p><strong>Puto</strong>Typically shaped into small, round portions, puto can be topped with cheese, salted egg slices, or even flavored with pandan or ube (purple yam) for extra color and taste. It's commonly cooked in specially designed molds and steamed until light and fluffy.</p>
        <p> Puto symbolizes community and celebration in Filipino culture, often appearing at fiestas, family gatherings, and religious occasions. Its simplicity, versatility, and comforting taste have made it a timeless favorite across generations.</p>
